# Counter
A counter create with javascript

I created a web application with javascript, and it is a counter which has three buttons,
plus, minus and reset, to add and subtract the main number that is zero.

I implemented a div that contains a paragraph with the main number,
then another div with a class counterDiv which contains the trhee buttons.
